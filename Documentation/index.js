You also have to uncheck \"draw labels above items, rather than within items\" _Default value is 28_ but I got better result with 20pixels. - Default 6 and dafault 5 theme TRACK_HEIGHT=25. - 25 Also works with Jane, Funktion. - iLogic V2 = 28 - iLogic V3 = 24 - Flat Madness and CubeXD= 22 TRACK_COLOR_SINGLE Do you want all the item folder to get the same color ?
